A label printer driver plugin for [InvenTree](https://inventree.org), which provides support for [Cups label printing servers](https://www.cups.org). If your printer is not cups compatible, you can setup a cups printing server. This [article](https://nerdig.es/labelwriter-im-netz-teil1/) describes how to setup a cups printing server for the DYMO LabelWriter 450 Duo. If you have a Dymo printer, you might also want to check out the dedicated [`inventree-dymo-plugin`](https://github.com/wolflu05/inventree-dymo-plugin) which is the recommended choice because it works more performant.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin needs `cups-devel` installed to install its dependencies. You can read more about the requirements at [`pycups`](https://github.com/OpenPrinting/pycups). If you're using `apt` as a package manager run `apt install libcups2-dev` before. For docker see [below](#docker).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For InvenTree<0.16 use this package with version `0.1.0`

Goto "Settings > Plugins > Install Plugin" and enter `inventree-cups-plugin` as package name.

### Docker

For docker installs you need to build your own docker image based on the inventree image to install the required system dependencies. The following `Dockerfile` is using a multistage build to only install what is needed onto the inventree image and do the building in a separate stage.

> [!NOTE]
> This only works for the inventree alpine based docker image which is shipped with inventree>=0.13.

To use it you have to do some slight modifications of the `docker-compose.yml` file and create the `Dockerfile` as follows:
